# 📝 Creating issues
1. Use a fitting template whenever possible.
2. Only talk about one topic (one bug, one feature) per issue.
3. Make sure your problem is reproducable.
4. Give as much useful information as possible, for example the steps you took that lead to a problem.

# 🛠️ Making pull requests

Thank you for helping out! By the way, take a look at [our documentation](https://github.com/oskarsh/Yin-Yang/wiki).

1. Give it a short and fitting title.
2. Create a draft if you are still working on it. That makes it possible for others to see what you are working on, while keeping maintainers from reviewing or merging it.
3. Make sure everything works before you mark it as "ready for review".
